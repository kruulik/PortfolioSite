        <h5>August 2016</h5>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>BlaBlaCar is the world's leading long distance carpooling service, connecting drivers with empty seats to people travelling the same way.</p>
        <p>I had the pleasure of working on a case study to redesign their existing search interface with two goals in mind:</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>A: </strong>Keep existing style while improve architecture</p>
        <p><strong>B: </strong>Find a new visual approach while keeping existing data</p>

          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Overall search is unidirectional and restricting, but simple</li>
            <li>Results return nearby cities (good), but no way to know proximity to actual destination (bad)</li>
            <li>
              Have the feeling I need to envision exactly what I want to book, as a user, rather than allowing the app to guide me</li>

          <br>
          <h4>User Ovservation</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Had no problem with basic search, but was totally lost when asked to book a specific date</li>
            <li>Did not notice first, nor understand meaning of most icons after they were pointed out (neither did I…)</li>
