        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>The website was a conglomerate of many different trips, offerings, services, and packages, arbitrarily grouped together in a way that was impossible to navigate intuitively. Returning users had trouble finding specific items, and new users were prevented from casually explosing the many great offerings.</p>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>Democratize access to content directly from the home page, allowing new users to see more of each category, andn reduce the overall depth of the site so that users are complelled to search and discover laterally, rather than having to dig deep.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Overhaul the content structure and organization, condesnsing it to two questions: "Where do you want to go?" and "What do you want to do?" New visual representation of services and destinations as a colorful mosaic, sourcing content from each sub-category.</p>

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>Highlight of existing user flow on the home page shows the lengthy process to finding a point of sale, and the many drop-off points along the way.</p>

        <p>Three primary groupings, as seen by a user on the home page.</p>

        <h3>Concept Diagram</h3>
        <p>Using Mindnode, I created diagram to illustrate the cahnges in content structure. The purpose of this was foremost as a visual guide, and second to demonstrate hw the same content from before (left side of diagram) can be plugged into the new groups and organized effectively (right side).</p>

        </div>
        <h3>Cards</h3>
        <p>Tours, Activities, Locations, will be presented together in one "masonry" style gallery on the home page. In order to provide consistency and scalability, each card shows only minimal pertinent information for that content group.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>Selection of Wireframes</h3>
        <p>Using Sktch, I put together wireframes and storyboards to illustrate a few key pathways in my redesign. Mobile and desktop versions were considered, with responsive layouts proposed for each.</p>
