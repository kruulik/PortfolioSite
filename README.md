# Portfolio Site


## Implementation

This site uses HTML5, SCSS and plain JavaScript. Gallery filtering is achieved through the [Mixitup][https://www.kunkalabs.com/mixitup/] plugin.

### Todo

[x] Toggle 'programming' filter by default
[] Move image assets to external storage
[] Add additional breakpoints for smaller devices
[] Move to Mixitup 3, which uses ES6 paradigms as opposed to jQuery-era selectors.
